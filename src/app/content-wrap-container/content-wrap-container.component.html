    <h1 id="tittle-math">What is pure math?</h1>
    <p id="content-math">Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside &nbsp;mathematics.&nbsp; 
        These concepts may originate in real-world concerns, and the results obtained may later&nbsp;turn&nbsp; out to be useful for practical applications, 
        but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated&nbsp;by&nbsp; such applications.<br>
        <br> 
        
        Instead, the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles.
        While pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least Ancient Greece, the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900,
        after the introduction of theories with counter-intuitive properties (such as non-Euclidean geometries and Cantor's theory of infinite sets),
        and the discovery of apparent paradoxes (such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable, and Russell's paradox).
        This introduced the need to renew the concept of mathematical rigor and rewrite all mathematics accordingly, with a systematic use of axiomatic methods.
        This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake, that is, pure mathematics.<br>

    <h1 id="tittle-physics">What is the physics?</h1>                   
    <p id="content-physics">
        Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time,
        and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.<br>
        <br>
        Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches 
        of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.
        Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. 
        New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.<br>
        <br>
        Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products 
        that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization;
        and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.
